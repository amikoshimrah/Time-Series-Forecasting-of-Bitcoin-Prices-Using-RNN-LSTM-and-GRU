# Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Bitcoin-Prices-Using-RNN-LSTM-and-GRU
ðŸ“˜ Project Summary:

This project demonstrates Time Series Forecasting for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) using advanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures â€” SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU.

The notebook covers:

Fetching and preprocessing Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with moving averages and volatility trends

Time series transformation for supervised learning

Model training and hyperparameter tuning

Comparative analysis of RNN, LSTM, and GRU model performance

Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE

Visualization of predictions vs. actual values

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, yFinance

Goal:
To understand temporal patterns in Bitcoin prices and build robust predictive models that can capture long-term dependencies effectively.
