# üíπ Time Series Forecasting of Bitcoin Prices Using RNN, LSTM & GRU

## üìò Project Summary
This project demonstrates **Time Series Forecasting** for **Bitcoin (BTC-USD)** using advanced **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** architectures ‚Äî **SimpleRNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU**.

The notebook focuses on analyzing and predicting Bitcoin price movements through deep learning models capable of capturing temporal dependencies and long-term patterns in financial time series data.

## üìä Objectives
- Fetch and preprocess historical Bitcoin price data from **Kagglehub**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with moving averages and volatility trends
- Transform time series data for supervised learning
- Train and tune **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU** models
- Compare model performance using metrics like **RMSE** and **MAE**
- Visualize predicted vs. actual Bitcoin prices

## üß© Workflow Summary

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Source:  [Bitcoin Historical Price Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data)
- Ticker: `BTC-USD`
- Data includes **Open, High, Low, Close, Volume**, and **Date** columns.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values and formatting timestamps  
- Normalization using `MinMaxScaler`  
- Creating supervised sequences (look-back windows)

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Visualized Bitcoin price trends  
- Computed moving averages for short-term and long-term trends  
- Analyzed volatility and rolling standard deviation  

### 4. **Model Building**
Built and trained three recurrent architectures for performance comparison:
- **SimpleRNN** ‚Äì Baseline sequential model  
- **LSTM** ‚Äì Long Short-Term Memory model to capture long-term dependencies  
- **GRU** ‚Äì Gated Recurrent Unit model for efficient training  

### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
Models were evaluated using:
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  

### 6. **Visualization**
Plotted actual vs. predicted Bitcoin prices to analyze model accuracy and lag behavior.  
Compared model performances visually and statistically.
